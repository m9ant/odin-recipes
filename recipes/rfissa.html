    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Rfissa is a moroccan traditional meal based on <em>Msemen</em> and other ingredients. It is also called Trid or Hemiss.</p>

    <p>You’ll find rfissa served for family gatherings and casual company meals. It’s also traditionally served on the third day following the birth of a baby, due to the health benefits that fenugreek offers a nursing mother. Of course, it can be offered at other times as well.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Msemen</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Lentils</li>
        <li>Saffron</li>

        <li>Parsley</li>

        <li>Cilantro</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps to follow</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the pot with the chicken on the stove over medium heat and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for about 15 to 20 minutes, until a rich sauce has formed. </li>
        <li> Add the drained lentils, parsley, cilantro and the water. Simmer, covered, over medium-low to medium heat for about 1 hour, or until the lentils are tender and the chicken is well-cooked. There should be rich, ample broth in the pot. (If there’s not, add a little water during cooking, tasting to be sure that the seasoning is not diluted.)</li>
        <li>Taste the broth for salt, then add the smen, swirling the pot to incorporate it into the broth. If desired, remove the chicken from the pot and place it under a broiler for a few minutes to brown and crisp the skin.</li>
